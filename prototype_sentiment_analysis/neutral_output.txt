Welcome to the basic sentiment analysis demo.
This project relies on a Java based menu system, coupled with Python to run sentiment analysis on a file.
This is currently intended to run in the terminal, making this extensible through the use of scripting langauges like Bash.
The menu options for this program are subject to change.

This program was created using Java SE 21 on VS Code.
