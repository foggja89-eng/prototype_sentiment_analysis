/*
* ErrorList.java -- this is a dedicated class to handle errors, in compliance with the single responsibility principle. 
* Right now, this is for a text-based menu system, so this will include color-coded output for the terminal. 
* TODO: ALL OF THIS WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE COLOR CODED INPUT. The more complicated logic is why everything gets its own method. See DSA Spring 2025 code.
