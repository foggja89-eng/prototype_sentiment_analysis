This project is a basic demonstration of sentiment analysis using Python. The menu system is based on Java for greater performance and extensibility as that is my primary programming language. The bulk of the processing is done in Python due to the comparitive simplicity of the programming langauge and available libraries for natural language processing. This project can be run in any terminal, but linux is preferred for the test scripts that will eventually be added for sample runs.
